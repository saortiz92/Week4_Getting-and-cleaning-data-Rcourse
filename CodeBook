 Getting and Cleaning Data course. Week 4 Peer reviewed assigment.

The data set that this code book explains is in tidy_data.txt file.

The README.md file of this repository  has background on the data collected. 

The data was treated as follows:

The zip file containing the source data is located at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The training and test sets were merged to create one data set, The measurements on the mean and standard deviation were obtained for each measurement, and the others were discarded.

The activity identifiers (originally coded as integers between 1 and 6) were replaced with descriptive activity names.

The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names (e.g. tBodyAcc-mean()-X was expanded to timeDomainBodyAccelerometerMeanX)
From the data set in step 4, the final data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The collection of the source data and the transformations listed above were implemented by the run_analysis.R R script (see README.md file for usage instructions).

Important info: 

The data "tidy_data.txt" is a text file, with  space-separated values. The first row contains the names of the variables, and the following rows contain the values of each of these variables.
Rows contain 79 signal measurements ( in average) for a given subject and activity.

The variables are: 

Identifiers

Subject

Subject identifier, integer, ranges from 1 to 30.

Activity

Activity identifier, string with 6 possible values:

WALKING: subject was walking WALKING_UPSTAIRS: subject was walking upstairs WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS: subject was walking downstairs SITTING: subject was sitting STANDING: subject was standing LAYING: subject was laying Average of measurements


The measurements are classified into:

Time-domain signals (variables prefixed by timeDomain), resulting from the capture of accelerometer and gyroscope raw signals.

Frequency-domain signals (variables prefixed by frequencyDomain), resulting from the application of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to some of the time-domain signals.
